## Product Justification

The inspiration from this project came from the struggles of transitioning into becoming an adult and trying to find a way for technology (for once) to help you stay motivated and keep yourself accountable to what you want to achieve

## Product Scope

By the end of the semester, I intended to produce:

- Front-End Calendar that the User can use to plan out their days
- Calibration Page
- Accountability Messages from Astro himself


Sadly I was only able to produce the Calendar to be fully functional but I intend on working on the other portions over this summer to have a fully rounded working application
